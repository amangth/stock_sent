One of the pushbacks most analysts have expressed about the Cybertruck is its higher-than-expected pricing, with Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster suggesting that, at the current production rate, it will probably lose $10,000 per vehicle.
  
An analyst at sell-side firm Canaccord Genuity said that the newest vehicle from the electric vehicle maker's stable is as polarizing as company CEO Elon Musk.
  
He noted that the Cybertruck beat a Porsche 911 “off the line” while towing another Porsche 911, and cited reviews that said that the former vehicle's turning radius is “incredible.”
  “It's just a car that will probably change the landscape of our roads,” the analyst said of the Cybertruck.
“Over time, we're guessing it will reach profitability similar to the other Tesla vehicles,” the analyst said.

While Tesla's inside bar leans bullish, if the stock continues to reject the 50-day SMA it could eventually break down from Tuesday's mother bar, which could cause volatility in the stock market to pick up.
  
On Tuesday, the EV giant closed at the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and on Wednesday, the stock was consolidating near the top of Tuesday's range, forming an inside bar pattern.
  
The Tesla Chart: Tesla's inside bar is taking shape near the top of Tuesday's trading range, which leans bullish for continuation later on Wednesday or on Thursday.
If the stock breaks bullishly from the mother bar, it will regain the 50-day SMA, which will give bullish traders more confidence going forward.

Black repeated his view that the underperformance is due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's comments regarding more imminent vehicle price cuts on the second-quarter earnings call.
  
Bottom Line At Risk: With price cuts, Tesla's demand is pulled forward and future demand falls as actual demand elasticity is low, Black said.
He required the management team and board to take a “longer-term view in running its business and invest in educating current legacy auto consumers why they should go EV rather than cutting price.”
  Tesla ended Thursday's session down 2.83% at $219.22, according to Benzinga Pro data.
“The lower price is always there,” he added.
  “Worse, TSLA is training consumers to think that if they wait, another price cut will come along,” Black said.

a difficult macroeconomic environment and some questionable decisions by Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent Tesla's stock price down 65% on the year.
  
“Tesla's inevitable meltdown (alright, so I was a mere eight years too early!) was a big contributor to this year's performance (and we remain short it, as I believe it has another 90% to go), as were our other short positions in the S&P 500 (via SPY) and, early in the year, the garbage-stock ETF ARKK (which I covered way too early, leaving lots of additional profit on the table),” Spiegel said.
  
In Stanphyl's December letter to investors, Spiegel discussed his bearish take on Tesla and revealed just how much his Tesla short position impacted Stanphyl's full-year returns in 2022.
  
However, Stanphyl also reported a 25.9% gain in 2021 even with Tesla shares up 49.7% on the year, highlighting Spiegel's ability to effectively manage risk in his short positions as well.

The Ford Chart: Ford negated its uptrend on Thursday by printing a lower high of $13.08 but the stock hasn't yet confirmed a new downtrend by printing a lower low.
For technical traders, Ford has both bullish and bearish indications on its chart and the price action on Monday and possibly Tuesday will determine at least the short-term trend.

Predictably, the near-zero interest rate environment benefited growth stocks.
  Since mid-2022, when the Fed started aggressively combating with rate hikes, this trend shifted in favor of value stocks.

In a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Powell suggested that the robust US economy and persistent labor market tensions might necessitate more interest rate hikes.
Investors are bracing for inflation and a surge in interest rates, which would lead to higher borrowing costs for corporations and consumers alike.
This assertion amplified existing fears about long-term high rates, pushing the 10-year US Treasury yield to its highest point in 16 years.
Sectors such as real estate and technology, which are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, along with influential entities like Tesla, were notably affected.

U.S. and world economies will force the Federal Reserve to stop raising U.S. interest rates  Those hopes have driven a sharp rally (juiced by short-covering) in government bonds over the last week, driving benchmark Treasury yields down all along the yield curve.
The 2-year yield, more sensitive to expectations of Fed action, was flat from Friday at 4.12%, but still down nearly a quarter-point from its peak.  
By the open, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 3.68%, down another 12 basis points from Friday's close and down 34 basis points from last week's peak.
The Nasdaq was underperforming after some disappointing news from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), which said its third quarter deliveries were around 4% below consensus forecasts.

 On Sept. 9, Tesla regained the 200-day SMA and traders and investors will be watching to see if the stock can hold above the level on the next retracement to the downside in order to continue trading in the recent bull cycle.
Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.
If Tesla is able to remain above the 200-day SMA, the 50-day will eventually cross above the 200-day, which will cause a golden cross to form on Tesla's chart.
If the stock retraces to print its next higher low over the coming trading days, bullish traders will want to see a reversal candlestick print above the 200-day SMA.","Personal Finance

If Tesla receives a bearish reaction to its earnings print, the stock may trend toward the 200-day simple moving average, which is likely to act as support at least temporarily.

Several analysts weighed in on the stock following the earnings print with three firms dropping their price targets, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

However, the 108% YTD rally (+38% in the last month) means that “the stock now better reflects” Goldman's bullish stance on the EV manufacturer
  “Overall we believe our view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets (which we attribute in part to its ability to offer full solutions including charging, storage, software/FSD and services with a direct sales model), is now better reflected in the stock,” they said in a client note.
  
Overall, Goldman remains “positive on EV adoption, and we continue to see the most investing opportunities among our broader set of suppliers, especially those with higher content to enable the shift to EVs and electrification.”
  Tesla stock is down 1.4% in premarket Monday.
  
The analysts remain positive on Tesla's long-term growth potential and competitive positioning.
While the downgrade move was mostly driven by valuation, the analysts also highlighted a “difficult pricing environment for new vehicles,” which they believe will hurt Tesla's non-GAAP gross margin in 2023.

Returns From Tesla Stock: Tesla's public debut on June 29, 2010, marked a turning point for the company.
A $1,000 investment in Tesla during its IPO would have transformed into approximately $157,365 today, representing an extraordinary return of 15,637% over a 13-year investment period.
  
With Tesla as his flagship venture, Musk's visionary mindset extends beyond electric vehicles, as evidenced by his involvement in ventures like SpaceX Neuralink , the Boring Company , and his acquisition of Twitter

Several analysts weighed in on the stock following the earnings print with four firms raising their price targets, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
  Baird analyst Ben Kallo maintains Tesla as a “Best Pick” for the second half of 2023 while taking note of cautions issued by the company and Tesla's declining margins.
  
While Kallo expected a pullback in Tesla based on lower volume production and the announcement of FSD transferability this quarter, the analyst sees any retracement in the stock as a buying opportunity.

  While Tesla's steep sell-off Thursday likely concerned bullish traders, the downturn hasn't been enough, so far, to negate the stock's uptrend.
If Tesla continues to move lower on decreasing volume, the stock is likely to print a bullish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or hammer candlestick, over the next few days, which could signal a reversal to the upside.

Tesla's price reduction strategy, which prioritizes higher sales volumes over profit margins, has notably improved its standing in competitive markets like China.
  
By prioritizing higher sales volumes at potentially lower profit margins, Tesla has been able to reduce prices in key international markets like the US, UK, and China.

He also brought up the irony of Tesla resorting to the shortest-term tool in the toolbox, namely price cuts to drive volume despite its strict adherence to “first principles and long-term strategic thinking.”
  Table-Pounder At Current Levels: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who appeared on CNBC Last Call, said he isn't worried about the sell-off seen in the past month.
The analyst sees Tesla's price cuts as a poker move for Tesla and Musk and more of an opportunity for the company, especially going into the next year and with the launch of the Cybertruck.
  
Black harped on Tesla not spending on advertisements to educate potential EV consumers and instead preferred price cuts as a strategy to push volume.
Short-Term Focus Confounds Analyst: Neither Elon Musk's political rants nor his canceled cage fight with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has caused the slump seen in Tesla stock over the past month, said Future Fund's Gary Black in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

The patterns Tesla developed on its chart prior to the split taking place are still intact, although technical traders will need to adjust their levels of support and resistance now that Tesla's stock price has essentially been divided by three.
 Bearish traders will want to see Tesla break down from the ascending neckline of the pattern on higher-than-average bearish volume to indicate the head-and-shoulders was recognized, which will also throw Tesla into a downtrend on the daily chart.
 Bullish traders can watch for Tesla to possibly break up above the upper descending trendline of the handle formation on higher-than-average volume to indicate the cup and handle pattern was recognized.
Tesla is set to reach the apex of the triangle on about Sept. 7, and if the stock breaks up from the pattern on higher-than-average volume, an uptrend may occur.","Personal Finance

The analyst said he expects Ford and GM combined could add another $3 billion to EV charging revenue for Tesla over the next few years in another accretive poker move by Musk and his company.
  
The launch of the Cybertruck later this year will also add to the Tesla growth story, the analyst said, adding that a few more new modes, including a sub-$30,000 EV, could be on the deck.
  
“At the end of the day, Tesla essentially owns the charging network ecosystem domestically and GM as well as Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) need access to it for success in their broader EV ambitions over the coming years.”

On Tuesday, Tesla opened slightly lower before breaking up from the flag on higher-than-average volume on smaller timeframes, which suggests the pattern was recognized.

Why This Analyst Is Bracing For Significant Stock Volatility Near Term","Benzinga - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has polarized the investment community and analysts, especially due to the recent surge in the stock price.

An analyst at Roth Capital Partners believes the stock is “egregiously overvalued.”
  What Happened : Analyst Craig Irwin , in an interview with Yahoo Finance last week, stated that after hitting a low point at the end of last year, Tesla stock has performed remarkably well this year.
The analyst also highlighted a weak demand environment, noting that Tesla had to aggressively cut prices to stimulate demand.
  Charging Boost: Irwin credited Tesla for its dominance in the NACS market, mainly due to its Supercharging network.
""So they've had some real wins and the valuation has taken off like a kite,"" the analyst said, calling the move from $100 to over $250 a ""reactionary move.""
  While he acknowledged Tesla as a great company that has played a significant role in transforming transportation, he points out the increasing competition from traditional automakers like Ford Motor Co .
Irwin says investors are concerned about the battery source for the rear-wheel drive Model 3 car, Tesla's highest-volume car, coming from China and also the competition.

Read more here...
  From a technical analysis perspective, Tesla's consolidation on Friday and into Monday had the stock trading in a double inside bar pattern.
  
The Tesla Chart: Tesla's inside bar pattern leans bearish, because the stock was trading lower before forming the pattern but the lower wicks on Friday and Monday's candlesticks may indicate the local bottom has been found.
If Tesla breaks up from the mother bar, the stock will enter the gap that was left behind on Thursday, which is a likely scenario because gaps on stocks fill about 90% of the time.
Traders and investors can watch for Tesla to break up or down from Thursday's mother bar on higher-than-average volume to indicate a future direction for at least the short term.

If Tesla closes Monday's trading session near the low-of-day, the stock will print a bearish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate lower prices will come again on Tuesday.
If the stock bounces up later on Monday to form a lower wick, Tesla will print a hammer candlestick, which could indicate the next low is in and a bounce is on the horizon.

ORTEX Analytics released its monthly Short Interest Insights report this week and said Tesla was the most profitable stock in the market for short sellers for the second straight month in November.  
Benzinga's Take: Tesla has long been one of the most shorted stocks, and ORTEX reported in October that Tesla has been the most profitable stock in the market for short sellers in 2022.

If Tesla continues to bounce higher on Monday, bullish traders will want to see the stock regain the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could propel the stock up to fill an upper gap that exists between $169.70 and $177.65.
  
Bullish traders may choose to wait to see if Tesla retraces lower on Monday and forms a bullish reversal candlestick above the most recent low of $152.37, which could indicate the downtrend is over and an uptrend is in the cards.
  
If Tesla fills the gap, bearish traders can watch for the stock to print a possible bearish reversal candlestick, such as a doji or shooting star candlestick, at the top of the empty range.
The pop higher was taking place on lower-than-average volume, which suggests Tesla may be experiencing a relief bounce because the bulls aren't showing strength.

When a stock breaks up from a bull flag pattern, the measured move higher is equal to the length of the pole and should be added to the lowest price within the flag.
  
The Tesla Chart: Tesla has created a possible bull flag pattern between June 27 and Friday, with the pole formed over the first five trading days of that timeframe and the flag formed since.
Bearish traders want to see big bullish volume come in and break Tesla down under the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the bull flag and confirm a short-term downtrend.","Personal Finance

Tesla's stock price saw a 13% decrease in August, after a notable high of $299.29 in July.
  
Tesla has introduced a new pricing strategy, reducing the prices of its Model S and Model X vehicles by $10,000 to attract more consumers.
 
Tesla's smart decision to lower vehicle prices could potentially lead to increased sales, resulting in a turn-around for the stock and putting it on a growth path once again.
  
This near-breaking of the $300 resistance level, which is a key psychological marker for investors, marked a remarkable 153% increase in the stock's value for the year.

If Tesla continues to consolidate under the 200-day SMA, the stock may gather the power to break above the level, which would give bullish traders more confidence going forward.
  
The Tesla Chart: The 200-day SMA acts as a strong level or support (when a stock is trading above the area) and of resistance (when a stock is under the level), making it difficult for a stock to slide through the 200-day on the first attempt.
  
If Tesla breaks higher over the next few days, Tuesday's low-of-day could serve as the next higher low within the pattern.
  
Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.

Black also emphasized several upcoming catalysts for Tesla's stock, including the Cybertruck launch, Model 3 refresh, and a licensing deal for full self-driving capabilities.
  
Furthermore, Black suggested that Tesla investors might be anticipating that the company won't quickly reduce configurator prices in the future.
Regarding Tesla's valuation, Black noted that the company's P/E multiple is currently 55 times the estimated earnings per share for 2024.
He drew parallels to the boost in volume that Tesla experienced following the Model Y launch, with volume growth accelerating from 36% in 2020 to 87% in 2021, attributing this phenomenon to the Model 3 refresh and Cybertruck generating increased interest in all Tesla models.

The upcoming Cybertruck launch event on Nov. 30 could hold the key to Tesla's stock trajectory, potentially squeezing short sellers out of their positions.
  
While Tesla shares have made a modest recovery since the beginning of November, shorts have seen a $1.76 billion decrease, but their market-to-market losses have increased by 9.89%, Dusaniwsky noted.
If Tesla's stock starts to rise, it could spell trouble for short sellers.
A short squeeze can occur when those who bet on a stock's decline are forced to buy shares to limit their losses as the stock climbs, thereby driving prices even higher.

Additionally, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva warned on Monday that 2023 will be a tough year for the world economy as the U.S., China, and Europe all deal with weakening economic output.
  
However, the new year is set to start on a more positive note, helped by gains in Europe after preliminary data from some of Germany's largest states indicated that the country's headline inflation is set to fall further in December.
  
Oil prices fell Tuesday, weighed by weak factory activity data from China, the world's largest crude importer and second-largest oil consumer, as surging COVID-19 infections disrupted production.
  
That said, trading is likely to be volatile as the longer-run prospects for China, the world's second-largest economy, will look more positive when the worst of the COVID waves have passed.

While assuring that he will no longer sell Tesla stock in the next 18-24 months, Musk said he has never missed any company meeting thus far and that Tesla has an amazing product roadmap.
Musk sold some of his Tesla stock to fund the acquisition, which weighed down on the stock.
Who can forget the infamous “funding secured” tweet from 2018 that brought him in the crosshairs of regulators and the legal system?
  Given Tesla disbanded its PR department in 2020, Musk has been serving as the company's mouthpiece, occasionally at events, earnings call and shareholder meetings but mostly through Twitter and his public appearances.

Bullish analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush and Tesla bear Gordon Johnson shared their thoughts on CNBC on Friday.
  
He noted that Tesla has cut prices in China, Australia and Japan already in the second quarter while its rivals have avoided making similar cuts, suggesting that the company is facing a demand problem.
  
The company's Supercharger was really “where the light bulb went up,” with General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard, the analyst said.

Price Action: In premarket trading, Tesla stock was shedding 2.89%, to $152.24, according to Benzinga Pro data.
  
Tesla bulls voiced opinions against the move, with fund manager Ross Gerber calling upon Tesla's board to immediately announce a stock buyback to mitigate the dilution stemming from Musk's stock sale.
Another Tesla bull, Wedbush's Daniel Ives, called the stock sale as fueling the black cloud around the EV maker's growth story.

The series of price cuts announced by the company since October in China, and since the start of this year in both China and the rest of the Tesla's global markets, have been a cause for analysts' concerns and Tesla investors alike.
The average analysts' price target for Tesla stock, based on data compiled by TipRanks, is $219.15, suggesting a 19% upside from current levels.
  
Tesla is widely expected to report the slowest year-over-year revenue growth since the second quarter of 2020 that followed the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.
Wedbush's Daniel Ives, a Tesla bull, said in a recent note that the ""price cuts came at a price and this tug of war between volumes and margins is now the big debate on the Street heading into earnings and the rest of FY23.","Personal Finance

Citing the continued price cuts from Tesla, despite the third-quarter price reductions not stemming the quarter-over-quarter decline in volume, Johnson said he maintained his Sell rating on the stock and year-end 2024 price target of $24.33.
  
Tesla bear Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research said the “automotive goldilocks” period is apparently over and Tesla's margins are regressing to the mean due to the company's repeated price cuts.
  
Commenting on the price cuts, Future Fund's Gary Black said Wall Street will likely reduce 2024 earnings per share estimate for Tesla by another $0.30-$0.50 per share.

In order for Tesla to negate its current downtrend, the stock will either need to rise up above $201 or print a higher low above Monday's low-of-day.
Traders can use moving averages to help identify a downtrend with descending lower timeframe moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term downtrend.
Although Wood bought the temporary dip on Monday, the longer-term trend on Tesla's chart points lower unless the stock can reverse from its current downtrend.
If Tesla closes the trading day near its high-of-day price, the stock will print a bullish kicker candlestick, which could indicate higher prices will come again on Wednesday.

It was 'I'm no longer involved in the day-to-day [at Twitter], I'm back to work,'"" Cramer said: ""So this is 'The Princess Bride move.""
  During Faber's interview with Musk, he asked the Tesla CEO why he speaks his mind on Twitter and tweets so many things that are often polarizing and controversial and make him a ""lightning rod for criticism.""
  After a prolonged silence, Musk responded, ""You know, I'm reminded of a scene in 'The Princess Bride' — great movie — where he confronts the person who killed his father and he says, 'Offer me money, offer me power, I don't care.'""
  Musk clarified that he is going to say what he wants to say, when he wants to say it and if the consequence of that is losing money, ""so be it.""
  Tuesday was the 13th consecutive trading session that Tesla shares finished higher, marking the longest surge by trading days in Tesla history.
Immediately following the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was interviewed by CNBC's David Faber
  The biggest takeaway from that day for investors was that Musk would be spending less time at Twitter and focusing on his role at Tesla, Cramer said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street.

He said he would prefer TSLA management to “invest a portion of the now $200M total spent on China price cuts ($60M on S/X, $140M on Monday's M-Y LR and Perf cuts) on advertising to build long-term brand equity for TSLA China's M-S, M-X, and M-Y LR/Perf franchises.""
  This, according to the analyst, will produce a halo effect for Tesla China's Model Y Standard Range and Model 3 franchises as well.
  
After aggressively cutting prices for its Model S and X vehicles in China earlier this week, Tesla announced Wednesday as much 6.9% reduction in prices for inventory Model S and X vehicles in China.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) reported record-breaking production and delivery numbers for the second quarter, but some skeptics argue that the optimistic outlook is already priced into the stock.
 
Recent reports indicate that Tesla has reduced prices for Model Y and Model 3 in Australia by A$3,900 and is also discounting Model 3 inventory vehicles in Canada and the U.S.
  As a long-term investor, Black expresses a preference for Tesla to explore new advertising strategies promoting electric vehicle adoption rather than relying on early-quarter discounts.
Black said margin worries remain an overhang as Tesla is already offering discounts on inventory at the start of the third quarter to drive volume.
With 466,000 deliveries reported by the electric vehicle maker, Black believes that the second-quarter adjusted earnings per share will surpass the current consensus of $0.78.
  IMO $TSLA will rise tomorrow.
While Tesla shares have more than doubled this year following a slump in 2022, the aggressive price cuts implemented by the company to boost volume have raised concerns about the stock's valuation.","Personal Finance

 Tesla is just one of the many large mega-cap companies to resort to stock splits during the pandemic.

uncertainty regarding CEO Elon Musk's plans for Twitter and how his acquisition may affect the EV giant.  
From a technical standpoint, Tesla's 15% plunge between Nov. 15 and Monday was the most likely scenario because on Nov. 16, the stock broke down from a bear flag pattern on the daily chart, which Benzinga pointed out on Nov. 17.  
Tesla is due to print at least another lower high over the next few days, and traders can watch for the stock to form a bearish reversal candlestick under $200 to confirm the trend is intact.  
The Tesla Chart: The measured move of Tesla's bear flag was about 20%, which indicated the stock could fall toward $163.
Tesla is trading in a confirmed downtrend, with the most recent lower high formed on Nov. 15 at $200.82 and the most recent confirmed lower low printed at the $177.12 mark on Nov. 9.","Personal Finance

 Tesla shares are trading in a continued downtrend in recent weeks after the company reported weaker-than-expected deliveries and results for the third quarter.
  
Tesla stock is down nearly 20% in October, although it is unclear when the analysts opened their shorts.
Elsewhere, the analysts said their fund owns Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) for AI exposure, while their Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) position is still open due to “surging profits.”
  They sold Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and have no position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), although they are looking for an opportunity to buy this internet stock.
  
Apple has also been moving lower, although not in as strong a downtrend as Tesla.

The Twitter factor
  That's not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla's stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost over 65% of their value since Musk's interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April, with a nearly 50% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.
“The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel's back on the stock.”
  Another reason Tesla's stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year, hurting car sales.
On a Twitter Spaces call last week call, Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla (TSLA) stock until at least 2024, if not beyond.
Tesla's questionable valuation
  Part of the problem with Tesla's stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year.","Electric Vehicle

Musk's Net Worth Erodes: Musk, the world's second richest person, saw his net worth drop sharply on Thursday.
Musk's net worth is, however, in the green for the year-to-date period, as he added $26.8 billion to his wealth.
What Happened: Tesla stock fell 9.75% to $162.99 on Thursday and intraday, it dropped to a low of $160.56, the lowest since late January.
  
To make matters worse, Musk brought up the issue of Tesla's ability to sell at zero profit and make up for it long-term with the high-margin autonomy software.

a game-changer that could unlock new markets for the electric vehicle (EV) giant and catapult its enterprise value by a staggering $500 billion.
  
The Financial Impact: Jonas estimates that Dojo could generate approximately $6.5 billion in cost savings for Tesla over the next couple of years, based on Tesla's claim of achieving six times the cost savings.
They emphasized that, considering Nvidia's inability to supply sufficient GPUs to meet Tesla's requirements, the investment in Dojo will yield significant returns over time.
  
Dojo, initially designed by Tesla to process video data from its extensive fleet of vehicles and enhance autonomous driving capabilities, could extend its applications beyond the automotive industry.

The Tesla Chart: If Tesla doesn't react bullishly to the kicker candlestick pattern and shoot higher, the stock may consolidate last week's 30% rise by printing an inside bar pattern.
The S&P 500 printed five green candles in a row last week and closed Friday's trading session about 3% above the 200-day simple moving average, boosted higher by Tesla's and Microsoft's earnings, which beat analyst estimates.
  
On Friday, Tesla closed with a big bullish kicker candlestick, which indicates the stock may rise again on Monday.

If that happens, the pattern leans bullish for later in the week because Tesla was trading higher before forming the inside bar.

Even if Needham's 2026 Services and Other revenue estimates for Tesla double, the firm's 2026 earnings per share estimate will move up by merely 1%, given the low gross margin nature of the business, Pierce said.

Related: Elon Musk Recalls The Time When Charlie Munger Told A Whole Table How 'Tesla Would Fail'
  An investment from Berkshire is a prestigious one, as any investment from Buffett or Munger suggests a company's financials are nothing short of spectacular.
  
Would such a move be in line with Tesla's strategy, and what would it take to convince its leader, Elon Musk , to make this change?
  What Happened: Recently, Musk suggested that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRKA) (NYSE: BRKB) should buy Tesla stock, and revealed that Buffett's partner Charlie Munger had the chance to invest in the automaker at less than 0.1% of its current valuation.
  
If enough investors demand them, or if Berkshire were to invest in the company, Tesla could be forced to reconsider its dividend policy.
  
Buffett and Munger have historically favored companies that pay dividends, and if they were to become major shareholders in Tesla, they could push for a change in the company's dividend policy.

Tesla is expected to report third quarter revenue of $24.21 billion and earnings per share of 75 cents, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
  While many investors will be looking at revenue and earnings per share, the company's margins and outlook could be the keys after reporting weaker-than-expected third-quarter deliveries, Ives said.
  
Ahead of third quarter earnings for electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), an
analyst breaks down the impact that margins, guidance and reported delivery numbers could have on the stock.
  
“The Street has shown patience but the time to see a line in the sand for the price cuts is now here we believe and investors will be listening for [CEO Elon ] Musk to discuss the philosophy around price cuts going forward especially in the US and China.”
  Ives said the price war in China is a “high stakes poker game” for Tesla with a focus on volumes over margins, a strategy that can't continue at the current pace going into 2024.
  
Other key issues expected to be addressed by Tesla and Musk during the third quarter report and earnings call are the Model 3 refresh, demand trends, Cybertruck expectations and timeline, and China, according to Ives.

Joseph Spak believes that in the mid-term, Tesla will continue to experiment with price elasticity, relying on its cost advantage and financial resources to fine-tune pricing and balance it with supply and demand dynamics.
This strategy, though affecting the short-term, may establish a robust foundation for Tesla's long-term success by allowing them to scale up, build a substantial customer base, and exert pressure on competitors with higher battery electric vehicle (BEV) cost structures.
  
The

In a letter to the Tesla board, the group says that Musk is not spending enough time and attention focused on issues facing the company, including increased EV competition from other automakers, and addressing issues important to the group, including allegations of a toxic work environment at Tesla.
  
Musk has a net worth of $175 billion, according to Forbes
  The letter alleges Musk's lack of focus at Tesla is causing problems for the company, such as a high turnover rate with its staff due to its work environment.
“In terms of governance, we'd like the board room to become less clubby and more independent and responsive to investors.”
  Musk is now essentially working for Tesla for free , with no cash salary, and after being granted a final block of stock options from a 2018 pay package earlier this year, there are no additional stock options that he can qualify for at the moment.
  
“Due to the board's failure to restrict the CEO's outside commitments and ensure he is focused on solving the many challenges the company faces, we have lost confidence in its members.”
  Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer at Amalgamated Bank, said that there are other investors who are concerned about Musk becoming distracted, especially with his recent purchase of Twitter , as well as his ownership and running of SpaceX and a number of other companies.

Looking into 2023, despite the Musk/Twitter circus and softer demand trends, Tesla still has potentially $5-$6 of earnings power and the ability to achieve 40%+ delivery growth in a brutal environment, Ives said.
Tesla will likely miss the reduced Street estimates for the fourth quarter, Ives said, citing higher inventory levels, the recent price cuts and overall production slowdowns in China.
  
Musk's stock sales despite his assertion that he is done with it, his political firestorm on Twitter and brand deterioration for Musk and Tesla have proved to be a complete debacle for the stock, the analyst said.
  
“Musk is viewed as ‘asleep at the wheel' from a leadership perspective for Tesla at the time investors need a CEO to navigate this Category 5 storm,” the analyst said.

This is in line with Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's comments on the earnings call that Tesla could sell its EVs for zero profit now and then yield ""tremendous economics"" in the future through autonomy.

 Still, BofA Global Research said in recent research note that stock splits ""historically are bullish"" for companies that enact them, with their shares marking an average returns of 25% one year later versus 9% for the market overall.
A stock split by Tesla, which would have be approved by its board of directors, would be the electric car maker's second since 2020, and it would follow stock split announcements by other major U.S. companies in recent years.
 Other S&P 500 companies with nominally high share prices, which analysts say could hint at a future stock split announcement, include Chipotle Mexican Grill, up 0.1% on Monday at $1,558, as well as Booking (NASDAQ: ) Holdings, trading near flat at about $2,247.
 Tesla said in a filing it would hold a vote at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting to increase the number of authorized shares in order to enable a stock split.","Personal Finance

There were 10 analysts who cut their price targets for Tesla on Thursday, by an average of $19.
  Some of those analysts reiterated their “buy” recommendations for the stock, even with the slightly lower targets.
  
“Every time the Fed raises the interest rates, that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car,” said Musk.
  Tesla's profit margins are still well ahead of those of traditional automakers.
Shares of Tesla tumbled nearly 10% Thursday following its disappointing earnings report on Wednesday evening, as it reported that its profit margins fell below the 20% mark that analysts had been forecasting.
But the analysts who are bears on the stock insist that Tesla is being forced to cut prices by weaker demand than it is admitting to.

Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell over 5% in premarket trading on Thursday after the company's disappointing third-quarter earnings report.
Instead of commenting on the falling margins and the constant price cuts seen globally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk focused on higher interest rates, and FSD/AI investments, and highlighted the difficult path for Cybertruck production over the next 12 to 18 months, he added.
  
In premarket trading, Tesla stock fell 6.19% to $227.67, according to Benzinga Pro data.

A popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla:
The Twitter factor

That’s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla’s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost 65% of their value since Musk’s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April, with a 44% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.


But Tesla’s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at Musk’s car company go well beyond Twitter.
On Thursday’s Twitter Spaces call, Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla stock until at least 2024, if not beyond.
Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder, has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.

  Tesla bear Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research noted that Wednesday's retreat was accompanied by heavy volume, as 209.88 million shares exchanged hands.
TSLA closing below its opening price, on such strong volume, likely suggest the session was the “reversal day that marked the end of TSLA's stellar/historical stock run,” Johnson said, citing his technical team.
  
Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded the stock from Overweight to Market Weight, citing the near-term stock run-up and fears of inventory build-up in the second quarter.

The only thing that the stock split changed is that existing investors now own three times as many shares of Tesla trading at one third of the price they ended at on Wednesday.


Companies with high share prices often split their stocks to make the cost of one share more affordable for individual investors.
The electric car company completed a 3-for-1 stock split after the closing bell Wednesday.
And the stock is still down about 15% this year, as investors worry about growing competition in the EV market from traditional automakers as well as Musk’s many possible distractions.","Personal Finance

Inc (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: TSLA ) to the S&P 500 index with the stock trading at an all-time high and the automaker sporting a $550 billion market capitalization.
  
Related Link: As Tesla's Stock Falls To New 2-Year Lows, How Are Its EV Peers Performing?
  Tesla's market cap has fallen to just $391.2 billion, but it remains the ninth-largest member of the S&P 500.
  
When Tesla was added to the popular S&P 500 index, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY (NYSE: SPY )), it was by far the largest stock ever added to the index.
Benzinga's Take: S&P 500 investors who were annoyed with S&P for adding Tesla at what many said at the time was a bubble valuation have every right to be irritated at the timing of the addition given Tesla's horrible performance over the past two years.
  
In fact, S&P booted Tesla from its environmental, social and governance (ESG) index in May 2022, citing concerns over Tesla's ""lack of a low-carbon strategy"" and ""codes of business conduct.""
  The reputation of controversial Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also taken a hit since the billionaire acquired the social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022.","Personal Finance

 Still, Tesla is valued at around $1.1 trillion by the market today, while Sacconaghi reminds investors that the14 largest traditional auto OEMs (who sell 99% of all cars, including 2% that are electric) have a collective market cap of $0.9T.  Hence, Tesla's market cap concentration (86% of the EV space, and 49% of the automotive space appears at odds with the fragmented and global nature of the auto market.

 The fact that Tesla can build out and secure key materials puts the EV company in “a strong competitive advantage,” Spak concluded.
For 3Q22, RBC is at 396k deliveries vs. consensus at 378k and we see 2H22 auto gross margins >30% as Shanghai gets back to pace, Berlin and Texas ramp and pricing gains continue,” Spak told clients in a note.","Personal Finance

  Under these circumstances, here's a look at the options market outlook on Tesla stock for this week:
  Resistance : There is significant open interest build-up at the $300 Call strike for options expiring on June 30.
The stock closed over 3% lower on Friday at $256.60 — just between the support and resistance level factored in by professional options traders last week.
  
Open interest figures only provide a fair idea about support and resistance levels.
Any major news break or macro event could lead to a significant movement in stock prices and cause a subsequent shift in open interest levels.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors in April that the cuts were generating increased demand for its cars, and that it now had more demand than its capacity to produce them
  But the lower prices have also squeezed earnings , and the second-quarter sales results marked the fifth-straight period in which Tesla produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers.
Critics of Tesla in the analyst community point to the gap between production and sales, along with the lower prices, as a sign of decreased demand for Tesla cars in the face of increased competition from established automakers.
  
The quarterly sales represented nearly 100,000 more than Tesla sold in all of 2019, the year before the pandemic.

  The EV company reported record sales of 466,000, nearly double the 255,000 it delivered in the year earlier quarter when sales were depressed from Covid-related lockdowns in China.

 Rosner is bullish on Tesla stock even in the case that the 2Q margin misses estimates.
 “We think investors should take advantage of the stock pull-back to get involved given margin pressure faced in the quarter would be temporary and longer-term operating leverage stays intact,” Rosner concluded.
 “We think the YTD 30%+ pullback in the stock largely reflects supply issues that are fast improving, providing a compelling opportunity to accumulate the stock into 2H and 2023 where volume growth and margin expansion could be meaningful,” the analyst added.
The analyst sees the potential for Tesla to report higher-than-consensus numbers for margins, “driven by good cost execution and continued pricing strength.”","Personal Finance

The Elon Musk -led company reported record-breaking second-quarter deliveries of 466,140 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of over 10% and a staggering 80% rise from a year earlier.

What Happened: According to a Wall Street Journal report citing a YouGov (LON: YOU ) survey, Tesla's approval rating has dropped to a net negative score of 1.4%.

Stellantis (BIT: STLA ), the owner of the Jeep, Chrysler, and Fiat brands, lost 3.5%, while Volkswagen (ETR: VOWG_p ) stock lost 3.4%, Mercedes Benz (ETR: MBGn ) fell 2.4%, and BMW (ETR: BMWG ) stock fell 1.6%, making them the four worst performers in the Euro Stoxx 50 index on a morning when European stocks were broadly higher in response to an improving inflation outlook in the U.S.
  Late Thursday in the U.S., Tesla said it will cut prices for its mass-market Model 3 and the Model Y SUV Crossover, in an apparent move to sustain sales after the company missed Wall Street forecasts for deliveries in the fourth quarter.
Any move by Tesla to lower prices is likely to hurt European carmakers, which have historically operated on relatively thin profit margins - especially Stellantis and Volkswagen.
""At the end of a turbulent year with interruptions to the supply chain, we have achieved a partial normalisation of cost inflation, which gives us the confidence to pass this relief onto our customers,"" a spokesperson for Tesla Germany said.
  
The news was the latest sign that Tesla - which during its startup phase had always had long waiting lists for its cars - is now encountering the same kind of demand problems faced by other mature auto companies.

""Long-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!""
  Tesla saw another US$700bn wiped off its value Tuesday on worries over production in China and the perceived absence of Musk while he concentrates on Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), the social media platform he acquired for $44bn in October.
  
Shares in the EV group have lost 70% of their value over the past year and look on course to be one of the top five worst performers in the S&P 500 index, though the stock managed a 3% rally on Wednesday and is set to notch up a similar rise on Thursday according to pre-market trading.
  
Tesla is expected to miss reduced Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter and needs to lower its sights for 2023, based on higher inventory levels, recent price cuts, and overall production slowdowns in China, according to Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives.

Musk could time the proposed sale to coincide with a federal tax bill of nearly $11 billion that would be triggered by exercising a chunk of his Tesla stock options worth $26.6 billion as of Monday's close.
This provision was dropped from the bill in favor of a 5% income tax surcharge on earnings of $10 million and an 8% surcharge on earnings above $25 million - a provision that also could ensnare Musk if it is enacted before his stock option gains are taxed at regular income tax rates.
MINIMUM TAX PUSH Tesla's practice of using the exercising of options as a tax benefit has long been a feature of U.S. corporate tax law, which allows some large firms to reduce their tax liabilities to zero as they compensate executives heavily with stock.
Yet the timing of his upcoming stock sale could solve a major tax headache for himself and save Tesla billions of dollars from its own tax bill before congressional Democrats clamp down on such breaks and try to hike taxes for the super-wealthy, tax and corporate compensation experts said.","Personal Finance

Giving his takeaways from the call, Gary Black, co-founder of Future Fund , said Musk assured that he wouldn't dispose of any more Tesla shares for the next 18-24 months.

The 'reduce' rating from HSBC hints at inflated investor optimism and reflects concerns over Tesla's aggressive growth targets and the capital-intensive nature of its non-core projects.
Firstly, HSBC analysts highlighted the substantial capital costs associated with Tesla's non-core electric vehicle (EV) projects, including Full Self-Driving (FSD) technologies, the Dojo supercomputer, and the recently launched Optimus robot.
InvestingPro Insights
  In light of the recent HSBC 'reduce' rating, it's worth considering some key InvestingPro Tips that provide additional context to Tesla's current position.
The bank's valuation takes into account the success of Tesla's FSD, Dojo, and Optimus projects by 2030 but anticipates heightened capital costs due to regulatory and technological obstacles.","Personal Finance

When Tesla announced its intention to pursue a stock split earlier this year, it said in a regulatory filing it believes “the stock split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value.”
Although deep-pocketed institutional investors don’t care as much about the company’s overall stock price, individual investors might be turned off by high-priced shares.
Splits can also boost demand for a stock because it puts the price within the reach of smaller, individual investors.


Stock splits are usually done to increase a stock’s liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the shares.","Personal Finance

Tesla is back to cutting prices in China, and investors don’t seem happy about it.


The price cuts, Tesla’s first since January, reflect rising competition in China, particularly within its fast-moving electric vehicle sector.


Tesla slashed prices several times in China between October and January after losing market share.
The trend could continue throughout the third quarter, they predicted, with market leaders such as Tesla, BYD and other brands becoming “increasingly more aggressive.”

China is vital to Tesla, with deliveries from its Shanghai Gigafactory alone accounting for more than half of its global sales, according to a CNN calculation based on data from the China Passenger Car Association.


Shares of the electric vehicle maker slipped Monday after it cut prices for some of its cars in the country again, reigniting a price war in the world’s biggest auto market.

  Why It's Important: The comments from Miller were interesting as they pointed to Tesla being a great company and market leader, but showed concerns about valuation and potential competition.
  
Miller also noted Tesla is a car company and shouldn't be valued as a technology company, one of the potential reasons its market capitalization had soared above peers in recent years.

""We argued that Tesla can take market share at a gross margin of c25% (excluding credits), which indeed is where we see investor expectations heading for 2024,"" the Berenberg analyst wrote in a new note to clients.
  
The Tesla Downgrade: Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik downgraded Tesla from Buy to Hold and raised the price target from $200 to $210, noting that the firm's buy thesis centered around ""misplaced fears of a price war"" has been accepted by the market.
  
Although lower gross margins are likely to offset a modest increase in deliveries in 2023, the Berenberg analyst sees increased cost efficiencies driving shares higher down the road.
  
Yanoshik referred to Tesla's volume advantage as weaponized capacity, but with shares up more than 20% since the firm upgraded the stock to Buy, he's tapping the brakes at least for a little while.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell sharply in premarket trading, extending the losses from Wednesday.

In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla fell 3.26% to $248.43, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
  
The reversal in the positive sentiment seen since Wednesday reflected a souring broader market mood after the Federal Reserve hinted at more rate hikes in the future despite the June pause.
The stock is moving in sympathy from the broader market, with the Nasdaq 100 futures down sharply on Thursday.
  
“Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into,” said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note released on Wednesday.

 Musk attaches less significance to the junk bond ratings, reasoning in the past that Tesla doesn't need debt and therefore the ratings do not impact the company.
The argument that Tesla's debt rating could have to do with the cyclical nature of the auto industry doesn't hold, as General Motors Corporation (NYSE: NYSE: ), Volkswagen (ETR: ) AG (OTC: VWAGY) have investment grade ratings, former Moody's credit officer Alexandra Merz said, Barron's reported.

 What Happened: Standard & Poor's and Fitch could upgrade Tesla's debt rating to investment grade this quarter, Black said.
These agencies rate Tesla's debt rating at Ba1 and BB+, respectively, suggesting the company's rating is at junk bond level, or — in other words — its debt is speculative.","Personal Finance

Elon Musk , claiming he was being distracted by commitments to other ventures such as Twitter.
  
The shareholders urged the board to ensure that Tesla has a CEO that ""dedicates adequate time and attention to the company"" and to ""overhaul the composition of the Board, including rolling off directors with close ties to the CEO.""
  ""Without a full-time CEO and a Board willing to provide meaningful oversight, we are concerned that Tesla will not be prepared to effectively navigate the increasingly competitive environment for EV sales, the evolving global regulatory landscape, shifting consumer preferences, ongoing supply chain challenges, and investors' expectations,"" the shareholders argued.

  ""Due to the board's failure to restrict the CEO's outside commitments and ensure he is focused on solving the many challenges the company faces, we have lost confidence in its members,"" the group further wrote.
  
In the letter, the group — which included Amalgamated Bank (NASDAQ: AMAL), Investor Advocates for Social Justice , the New York City Comptroller's Office and Sisters of the Good Shepherd — criticized the billionaire entrepreneur for allowing Tesla to lose market share in the electric vehicle market while running multiple companies like Twitter, SpaceX and The Boring Company
  ""The Board has allowed the CEO to be overcommitted at a time when the company faces critical challenges, including increased competition, regulatory scrutiny, and a stock slide,"" the group wrote.
  
The group requested a meeting with the Tesla board to discuss its concerns and suggested solutions by May 25.

to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List"", following last night's announcement of the company's collaboration with General Motors (NYSE: GM ), allowing GM-built electric vehicles to use Tesla's supercharger network.
  
They thus estimate the company is ""on track to hits its 1.8 million unit delivery bogey for the year and should be able to do it with a margin story that troughs over the next 1-2 quarters and ramps back up into FY24.""
  As such, the analysts argue ""with its supercharger network, energy business, AI driven autonomous path, unmatched battery ecosystem, and increased production scale/scope globally,"" Tesla has now further solidified its position as the undisputed EV leader, and conclude ""Musk and Tesla are playing chess while other automakers are playing checkers,"" as they raise their price target to $300 and add the stock to ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""
  TSLA is trading over 4% higher in premarket on Friday, extending an over 117% gain YTD.
In their latest note on the EV giant , the analysts argue that with the GM deal now in place and a similar deal with Ford (NYSE: F ) announced a few weeks prior, ""Tesla now essentially owns the charging network ecosystem domestically.""
They see the development as ""a large monetization opportunity for the company in its supercharger story,"" as both GM and Ford will require access to Tesla's charging infrastructure ""for success of its EV strategy and broader EV ambitions.

  Charging deals aside, the analysts also believe ""Tesla is seeing steady demand post price cuts in the US and China with margins now in stabilization mode that should bottom over the next 1-2 quarters.""","Electric Vehicle

Elon Musk's Preoccupation With Twitter Worries One Of EV Maker's Most-Vocal Backers","Benzinga - Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: TSLA ) shares fell 6.27% on Monday, defying the broader market rally.

Twitter Controversy Hurts: Future Fund co-founder Gary Black, whose Future Fund Active ETF (NYSE: FFND) holds about 5,012 shares of Tesla for a 9.41% weighting, took to Twitter to share his views on the stock's weakness.
  
The fund manager was referring to the billionaire's preoccupation with Twitter
  The firm's flagship AdvisorShares Gerber Kawasaki ETF (NYSE: GK) exchange-traded fund has Tesla as its top holding, with a weighting of 7.64%.
  
Who's In Control: There's nothing wrong with Tesla other than the fact that its CEO works at another company, said Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.
The market has voted that the Tesla brand stands tarnished by the “Twitter drama.”
  “Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends to show off Tesla in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla's brand equity,” Black added.

 “Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing.
 “If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”
If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.

Perhaps more telling: Some footnotes in the filing disclosing details of the sales, along with the timing of the last two equity infusions into SpaceX, raise the possibility that Musk is shifting some of his wealth from publicly-tradedinto shares of his privately-held company SpaceX.

His timing is good, as the sales free up cash at a time when Tesla is doing very well in the market, becoming the sixth company in history to be worth $1 trillion , and lifting Musk himself to the status of the richest person on the planet.
And this isn't the first time this year that a Musk sale of Tesla shares for purposes other than paying taxes was closely followed by SpaceX reporting a new infusion of equity investment.
On November 15, a few days after he made that unusual sale of shares from his trust, SpaceX disclosed it had raised $388 million in additional equity investments from an undisclosed investor.


It's not clear how much cash Musk had available to him to invest in SpaceX before he started selling his Tesla shares on November 8.
Musk sold shares immediately after exercising the options, with the SEC filing noting that the transactions were made ""solely to satisfy the reporting person's tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options.""","Personal Finance

The analyst offered a warning for traditional automakers and Tesla competitors as Tesla lowers prices on vehicles and sees lower operating margins.
  
The analyst said he is struggling to see how Tesla will be able to meet expectations of 2.4 million to 2.5 million units without a new model or more price cuts.
  “Make no mistake – recent price cuts in Q2 reflect Tesla's needs to stimulate demand and are an explicit trade off of margins for volume.”
  
The Tesla Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $220 to $200.
  
“Particularly Elon Musk's statements that the company could potentially sell a car at a loss today in order to capture far larger lifetime value of the vehicle's recurring revenue going forward.”
  The expectation isn't that prices get cut to break-even operating margins, but the comment could show where Tesla is eventually headed, he said.

analysts with the research company believe FY24 consensus margin and volume estimates remain too high.
  
Bernstein believes that Tesla might need to guide for lower deliveries compared to consensus estimates for the next year, which would likely result in reduced profit margins.
  
“Throughout this year, Tesla bulls have been calling for margins to bottom as ongoing cost reductions increasingly offset the impact of price cuts,” write the analysts in a note.
Consensus projections expect Tesla to produce around 2.3M units in 2024, a 500,000 unit increase from the previous year.
However, to achieve 500,000 units in 2023, the automaker had to reduce prices by approximately 16%, which put significant pressure on their overall operating margins, decreasing them by 750 basis points.

Black attributed the after-hours sell-off in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares to comments from Li on Meta's earnings call that the fourth quarter and 2024 revenue would be highly dependent on macro factors.
  
What Happened: Meta CFO Susan Li's response to a question on whether the geopolitical situation has impacted Meta's ad business so far in the fourth quarter took the stock from $308 to $290 in the after-hours trading, Black said.
  
The after-hours post-earnings call decline is unwarranted, given Meta's fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $36.5 billion to $40 billion surrounded the consensus estimate of $38.5 billion, he said.
  
Meta Platform, Inc.' s (NASDAQ:META) shares rose immediately after the release of the
company's third-quarter results but reversed course after the earnings call.","Personal Finance

Is the fact that Musk seems to be spending a lot of time focusing on Twitter, his new $44 billion social media toy, a problem?

""Clearly, [Tesla's] share price performance has been hurt by the incessant noise surrounding Twitter since Elon Musk completed his acquisition in late October,"" said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson in a recent report.


Nelson nonetheless has a ""strong buy"" on Tesla, noting in particular that he thinks worries that Musk will have to sell more Tesla shares to help Twitter are overblown.

The analysts believe the valuation is more justified now after the recent pullback in Tesla stock that has created a more balanced risk/reward in the near term.
Analysts highlighted the three key points:  Some of the prior baked-in expectations that Citi didn't agree with are out of stock;  Citi is slightly above consensus for Q4-2024E EPS despite reduced near-term EPS estimates; and  Macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising.  
Under the current macro, we'd like to build more conviction, so for the time being we regard risk/reward as balanced here,” the analysts concluded.

However, we believe that prices cuts underscore the highly competitive nature of the auto market, where sustained high margins and high volume is unprecedented, and which we believe is necessary to justify Tesla's premium valuation.
As investor sentiment has rebounded, a new Tesla bull case has emerged arguing that Tesla has a durable structural cost advantage, which will allow it to capture outsized volume and dominate the EV market and capture favorable economics over the longer term.
The top 5 highest volume EVs collectively lost share in every major market in each of the last two years.
  
The analysts believe this will be challenging, given Citi does not expect Tesla to have a new high volume offering before 2025, and Cybertruck will likely only contribute modestly next year.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk received huge compliments from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) annual shareholders' meeting held over the weekend.
 
Tesla investor and fund manager Gary Black took to Twitter to weigh in on the comment and the reason why the famous investment duo of Buffett-Munger has stayed away from the electric vehicle company's stock.
  
Munger's comment that they don't want to compete against Elon and they don't want that much failure suggests they don't like taking that lot of risk when they invest, Black said.
  
What Happened : There is a huge difference between value and growth investors, said Black, adding that ""Warren and Charlie want more certainty.

Tesla stock price closed at $160.67 on Tuesday and is up 30.4% year-to-date (YTD).

 While stock splits make shares of a company cheaper for its employees and investors, some brokerages already allow customers to buy fractions of individual shares, which makes the benefit of stock splits less exaggerated than in the past.
 Tesla will also ask shareholders to vote to reduce its board of directors' terms to two years from three.
 Following a pandemic-induced rally in the technology shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), too, have in the recent past split their shares to make them more affordable.
The proposal will be put to vote on August 4 and if approved, it would be the latest after a five-for-one split in August 2020.","Personal Finance

Rusch believes that Musk's acquisition and subsequent management of Twitter has “severely damaged” the sentiment around Tesla stock.
He continues to believe the electric vehicle (EV) maker is “leveraging unparalleled expertise in EV-related materials and AI coupled with a multi-year data advantage in materials performance and self-driving to drive significant cost and performance advantages in the transportation space.”
  As of 06:30 EST (11:30 GMT) Tesla stock is up 4.6% on the news Musk may quit as Twitter CEO.
  
We see potential for a negative feedback loop from departures of Twitter advertisers and users due to inconsistent standards resulting in increased financing needs that may lead to incremental TSLA sales just as Tesla's competitive environment intensifies,” Rusch added.
  
The downgrade move comes on the same day when Musk indicated he may step down as Twitter CEO.","Electric Vehicle

(NASDAQ:TSLA) price cuts have alienated another long-time bull, who dropped his bullish stance and tempered his price target for the stock.
 
The Tesla Analyst: Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois downgraded Tesla stock from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $230 to $185.
  
The auto industry's ""structurally low returns may prevail over Tesla in the end, since it is harder to challenge a large established industry than create a new one,"" the analyst said.
  
Tesla's strategy of growth over margin has its logic and resets expectations, Houchois said.
Telsa's stepped-up transition to a world of sustainable energy and resource efficiency may slow down electric vehicle penetration and accelerate profit normalization for the industry, analyst Houchois said in a note.

This is evident from the erosion in Tesla's market share from 79% in 2020 to 65% this year, the report said.
  
Tesla remains a clear leader in the EV race, although there is no denying the fact that its share of the overall market is shrinking amid competitive pressure.

  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas had an Outperform rating and lowered the price target from $400 to $380.
  
The analyst said Tesla “obliterated” its bull thesis with commentary on items like the Cybertruck, Model 3 Highland, growth rates and the price of vehicles were cautious by Musk.
  
“Bulls can argue a bottom is in, and we agree, but bottoming at a lower absolute level vs. expectations is likely to increase pressure on consensus EPS estimates.”
  One key item moving forward for the analyst is pricing with the potential that Tesla could put pressure on rivals to lower prices, which could impact their profitability.
  
“Tesla left open the door for more price cuts ahead as Musk discussed a challenging macro environment with high-interest rates that has clearly created a Rubik's Cube backdrop for Tesla to navigate with consumers.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the witness stand for a second day on Monday and attempted to explain the thought process behind his controversial “funding secured” tweet from 2018, pushing back at the idea that it was partly a joke.


Jeff Chiu/AP

On Friday, Musk took the stand for about 30 minutes and testified that his tweets do not cause Tesla’s stock price to move higher or lower.
Musk, Tesla and company directors are facing a shareholder lawsuit over the tweet, in which the billionaire said that he was thinking about taking Tesla private for $420 a share and had “funding secured.”
Musk testified Friday that no one at Tesla reviewed his tweets in 2018 before he published them.


Subramanian said that when public companies go private, as Musk was proposing, there’s a much more extensive and rigorous process than what Musk and Tesla had gone through.","Electric Vehicle

In case Tesla delivers higher-than-expected numbers, the beat “could be a catalyst for the stock, as expectations have come down amid signs of softening demand.”
  On a more negative note, the analysts also argue that inventory is likely to remain elevated.
  
Barclays analysts also expect Elon Musk's company to continue cutting prices to increase demand as Tesla can better afford price cuts relative to its rivals.
  
Analysts expect that Tesla will manage to deliver 425,000 EV units in Q1, which compares to 405,000 delivered for the same period last year and to the consensus of 420,000.
  
Finally, the analysts also discussed Tesla benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is seen as a “pleasant boost, but will likely step back after March.”","Electric Vehicle

“While Tesla is increasingly exploring other demand creation levers besides MSRP cuts, we continue to believe that the company will need to further lower prices this year and/or next year to achieve its volume targets.”
  The analyst said the market is valuing Tesla as an artificial intelligence company alongside its automotive business, and may be putting too much weight into its charging partnerships.

The analysts believe that Tesla canceling Cybertruck “would probably be positive for shares.”
  “With 2024 already a lost year for growth, it would help Tesla refocus on an edge that was built on simplicity, scale and speed.”
  Instead of spending significant resources on Cybertruck ramp, the management should focus on on “ high volume global segments and supply of 4680 for Model Y.”
  “Allocating capital to support residuals would be a better use than Cybertruck.”

The analysts argue that “Tesla looks stuck in a slow lane for another 12-18 months, unable to capitalize on peer delays while European legacy OEMs launch $/€25k EVs next year and Chinese carmakers set a new pace of shorter product cycles.”
  “We appreciate future value from FSD (incl licensing) or Optimus, but not as near-term substitutes to solid core performance.

However, it was anything but “secured.”
  The plaintiffs — several Tesla shareholders who alleged that they lost significant portions of their investments in the wake of the share price volatility following the tweet — are seeking monetary damages from Musk, Tesla and other Tesla directors in their lawsuit.
  
Tesla (TSLA) shares initially climbed 11% on the day of Musk's original “funding secured” tweet, but they never reached that promised $420 level, reaching a high that day of $387.46.
The jury's verdict will end a three-week long trial over a class-action shareholder lawsuit regarding the tweet, in which the billionaire said that he was thinking about taking Tesla private for $420 a share and had “funding secured.”
Musk in his testimony , however, argued that his tweets do not cause Tesla's stock price to move higher or lower.

The analyst believes Tesla is gaining market share in China, its key market, amid price wars, as evident from the record China quarter in Q2 (based on analyst estimates).
  
However, the analyst thinks the impact of price cuts on Auto gross margin (ex-credit) and overall margins will be a key focus in Q2 earnings results.
  
With the street finally recognizing Tesla's partnership with Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F) and General Motors Co (NYSE: GM), the analyst believes the sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally 'starting to get tapped into.'
  Ives estimates EPS of $3.33 in 2023 and $4.65 in 2024.
The analyst notes that Q2 deliveries of 466k strongly beat the consensus estimate and aided the stock's upward movement, which is expected to continue into H2.

Criminally Bullish'","Benzinga - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is apparently facing a demand problem amid economic uncertainties and intense competition.

The direct sales model used by the likes of Tesla and most other U.S. EV makers will likely prove a massive headwind to margins if the global auto industry enters a recession, Johnson said.
  
This, according to the analyst, will increase fears that Tesla has a demand problem in its largest and only profitable market in China.
A collapse in China sales, starting in May
  April Shanghai factory data will likely show Tesla produced 9,000 more cars than it sold for the month.
Johnson said peak earnings for Tesla may be in the rear-view mirror, as new entrants and all major OEMs unleash new EVs at various price points, better interiors, similar or faster charging speeds and much better quality.

Morgan Stanley analysts also wrote in a note, “Since earnings were released, we have fielded questions about Tesla's pricing strategy…asking whether we are witnessing a strategic 'masterstroke' or a potential 'blunder' that threatens Tesla's long-term profitability and brand strength.
At the start of the launch, we asked the 36 attendees via show of hands who believed Tesla's share price would outperform the stock market over the next 6 months.
The survey consisted of one question asking survey respondents how they believe Tesla will perform over the next six months, with a multiple-choice answer ranging from “Significantly Outperform” to ""Significantly Underperform”.

PSNY is primarily bearing the brunt of a deterioration of EV demand, amplified by the price discounting by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), creating a challenging environment, the analyst cautioned.
  
The impact is especially challenging for PSNY as the PS2 model, which currently accounts for all of PSNY's volume, competes directly against Tesla's Model Y and Model 3.
  Lastly, PSNY also faces questions on PS3 sales in the U.S. amid increased uncertainty on the shape of EV uptake beyond the wave of early adopters that were highly supportive of the ramp of Tesla and the initial sales of EVs from other OEMs, the analyst notes.

Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited (NASDAQ: PSNY) to Underweight from Equal Weight, lowering the price target to $3 from $5.

The Tesla Analyst: Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating and $330 price target for Tesla shares.
Potential Tesla sentiment concerns and decelerating EV demand, particularly in China, could result in the stock testing Morgan Stanley's $150 bear-case target before the year-end, Jonas said.
Tesla shares are currently in the “throes of bearish sentiment momentum,” as investors are increasingly concerned over the potential for consumer sentiment getting hit and, in turn, impacting the company's business in the near term, Jonas said in a recent note.  
One of the main drivers that drove Tesla shares to “tera-cap” status in recent years was the ability of investors to model the outlook for the company's core EV and energy storage businesses, the analyst said.","Personal Finance

A California jury has ruled that Elon Musk is not liable for losses experienced by Tesla shareholders following his controversial “funding secured” tweet from 2018.


However, it was anything but “secured.”

The plaintiffs — several Tesla shareholders who alleged that they lost significant portions of their investments in the wake of the share price volatility following the tweet — were seeking monetary damages from Musk, Tesla and other Tesla directors in their lawsuit.


Tesla (TSLA) shares initially climbed 11% on the day of Musk’s original “funding secured” tweet, but they never reached that promised $420 level, reaching a high that day of $387.46.
The unanimous verdict, announced Friday in US District Court, ends a three-week long trial over a class-action shareholder lawsuit regarding the tweet, in which the billionaire said that he was thinking about taking Tesla private for $420 a share and had “funding secured.”
Musk in his testimony, however, argued that his tweets do not cause Tesla’s stock price to move higher or lower.

 The analyst spent a day in investor meetings with a visit to Tesla's new plant in Berlin.
 Tesla's Berlin plant currently produces around 1,000 units per week on a 2 shift/5day schedule.
 The analyst wrote that “Tesla expects a further step down in costs from a new platform in 2024, likely a robotaxi given recent comments from CEO Musk, although we understand some flexibility on product concept.
Though the analyst is concerned with how many units can be sold with Tesla's limited line-up, Tesla sees scope for 3-4M units combined for the Model 3 & Model Y. In Jefferies' view Tesla continues to challenge the industry's business model at multiple levels.","Electric Vehicle

During the earnings call, CEO Elon Musk talked about the company's hopes for a margin recovery and fully autonomous driving in the next year while highlighting Tesla's bustling energy storage business.
The company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 were in line with expectations, so on the whole, the headline numbers were at best, underwhelming.

Tesla is expected to report record earnings after the bell Wednesday, but it might not be enough to satisfy anxious investors.


Beyond giving guidance on sales and profit margins, Ives said it is important that Musk reassure investors about non-operational issues that have become a headwind for Tesla shares in the last year.


US buyers are now paying $44,000 for the basic version of the Model 3, $3,000 less than they were paying in late November.

That makes any guidance about future sales and profit margins that Tesla and its controversial CEO Elon Musk make Wednesday particularly important, especially after its once high-flying stock plunged 65% last year.


And much of the news the last nine months has been about Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter and his sale of nearly $23 billion worth of Tesla stock to help fund that purchase.
Some of those sales came after Musk had declared on Twitter that he was done selling Tesla shares.

Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed income dent with an original maturity of a year or more.
Even without the two recent upgrades, Tesla's five-year credit-default swaps were trading in line with high-grade debt, it added.
  
Why It's Important: Having an investment-grade credit rating is important because it indicates a relatively low risk of default.
Standard & Poor's, a Moody's rival, upgraded its credit rating for Tesla from “BB+” to “BBB,” in October, premised on improving production and solid cash flow prospects.

 If Tesla suffers a bearish reaction to its earnings print and breaks down from the bear flag pattern, the measured move is about 15%, which indicates Tesla could drop toward the $880 level.
 For the first quarter, analysts, on average, estimate Tesla will report earnings per share of $2.26 on revenues of $17.8 billion.

BYD Debate: 'Charlie Munger And Many On Wall Street Do Not Understand...'","Benzinga - After billionaire investor Charlie Munger came out all guns blazing about Chinese electric vehicle startup BYD Manufacturing Company
Limited's (OTC: BYDDY) (OTC: BYDDF) superiority over Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Ark Invest's Cathie Wood chimed in with her take on the matter.
  
The lack of a sub-$30,000 car in China could be impacting Tesla's volume, according to Future Fund's Gary Black
  Tesla generates far better profit per vehicle compared to BYD.
Only when plug-in hybrids are included, BYD's 2022 sales of 1.86 million vehicles outnumber Tesla, which is a battery EV pure play.
  
Tesla's profit per vehicle was $9,400 in the April-December period compared to $1,820 for Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) and $1,454 for BYD, a Nikkei report said earlier this year.
  
Giving the rationale for his preference for BYD over Tesla, Warren Buffett's trusted business partner said while Tesla reduced prices in China twice last year, BYD has increased its prices.","Electric Vehicle

Shares briefly shaved their after-market losses when Musk mentioned the buyback, only to see the stock lose even more ground after the company moved off its 50% sales growth target.
Musk insisted that the target miss is the result of a logistics problem, as the company has had trouble finding the number of ships, trains and car-carrying trucks needed to make the deliveries by the end of the quarter.
In an effort to boost the company’s stock price, Musk did tell investors that “it is likely” that the company will do a share buyback “on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion” worth if its stock.
But while the company said “over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve a 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries,” CFO Zach Kirkhorn did concede during the investor call that “on the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year.”","Personal Finance

2 more downgrades
  Coherent (NYSE: COHR ) shares fell nearly 4% pre-market today after Rosenblatt downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $55.00.
  While the firm believes Coherent will benefit from AI when the pods open and Ethernet is more widely deployed starting in H2/24, it is concerned in the near term about further shoes to drop in Networking, primarily due to high Telecom inventories, and Lasers, due to macro and competition.
  
Tesla downgraded to Equalweight
  Barclays downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) to Equalweight from Overweight while raising its price target to $260.00 from $220.00, noting that the recent sharp run-up in shares is ignoring questions on near-term fundamentals.
  
In a note to clients yesterday, Morgan Stanley stated that near-term inventory challenges could see the company's 2024 guide potentially below consensus expectations.
  
While moving to the sidelines, the firm still views Tesla as the leading winner among OEMs in the EV race with long-term potential.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk returned to the witness stand for a third day in a California court room Tuesday, as he testified in a class-action lawsuit over his controversial “funding secured” tweet from 2018.
Musk, Tesla and company directors are facing a shareholder lawsuit over the tweet, in which the CEO said that he was thinking about taking Tesla private for $420 per share and had “funding secured.”
Musk has argued during the trial that his tweets do not cause Tesla’s stock price to move higher or lower.
Musk said Tuesday that he’s never had trouble raising money in his career, despite not securing funding for any bid to take Tesla private.


Musk testified that he talked to executives of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund about the money he would need to make Tesla a private company.","Options

continued weakness has brought the stock to a 2-year low.
The current share price offers approximately 100% potential upside to Morgan Stanley's $330 price target, which is the highest upside to target seen from Tesla in over 5 years.  
However, as the company approaches Morgan Stanley's $150 bear case, driven by price cuts in China, decelerating EV demand, and other market currents, analysts believe that there may be a value opportunity emerging.  
In a slowing economic environment, we believe Tesla's 'gap to competition' can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary.”

The trial is a shareholder class action lawsuit which alleges that Musk manipulated Tesla's stock in 2018 when he tweeted that he was considering taking the company private at $420 per share and had ""funding secured"" to do so.
  
The trial will determine if these tweets had an impact on shareholders and the company's share price and whether Musk or the company should be held liable and pay damages, CNBC said.
  
This caused Tesla's stock to become highly volatile in the weeks following the tweets.
  
In the motion to transfer venue, the attorneys argued that Musk has received negative publicity in California after taking over Twitter in October 2022 and implementing a series of chaotic firings and layoffs, the American news outlet added.

In 2020, the Model Y added 40% of the crossover utility vehicle market to Tesla's TAM, according to Black, which resulted in Tesla's stock increasing by 743%, compared to the Nasdaq 100 index, which increased by only 48%.
  
To Rise: Black expressed confidence in Tesla's global EV market share returning to 20%, premised on the Cybertruck and the Model 2 for the masses.
  
An analyst, however, sees the possibility of a reignition of the rally.
  What Happened: Tesla's total addressable market, or TAM, will increase from 30% to 100% of the industry due to the addition of Cybertruck and the rumored $25,000 Model 2, Black said.
  
He was replying to a comment by one of his Twitter followers who expressed concerns that Tesla will likely continue to bleed share as there is “a new EV every day on the market.”
  Price Action : Tesla closed Wednesday's session down 3.35% at $180.54, according to Benzinga Pro data.

What Do They Say: “We believe leaving earlier than originally thought by the end of the year is a positive development for Tesla as well as SpaceX with Musk needing to spend more and more time on these golden child platforms rather than Twitter,” said the three analysts including Daniel Ives John Katsingris and Steven Wahrhaftig
  “With the tweet this afternoon, Musk's reign as CEO of Twitter has finally come to an end and thus will be a positive for Tesla's stock starting to finally remove this lingering albatross from the story,” the analysts said.
  
Elon Musk announced Thursday that he is stepping down as CEO of Twitter.

Tesla reported a drop in third-quarter earnings as the electric vehicle maker fell short of Wall Street expectations.


On a call with analysts, Tesla CEO Elon Musk talked at length about the impact of higher interest rates on car buyers and the demand for Tesla’s vehicles.
Tesla reported adjusted earnings of $2.3 billion in the quarter, or 66 cents a share, down 37% from a year earlier and the smallest profits it reported in two years.
He said the rise in rates is part of the reason for the price cuts by Tesla this year.


Tesla has been repeatedly cutting the prices of its vehicles to boost sales demand in the face of growing electric vehicle competition from established automakers.

 Tesla's (TSLA) stock is on the rise after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares to ""Overweight"" from ""Equal Weight.""
Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the note.
  
Jonas believes Tesla's Network Services (SaaS /Dojo cloud services) will not only be a revenue driver for the company, it will also help boost the prospects of Elon Musk's other businesses: X (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, Tesla's battery business, even Neuralink and The Boring Company, This is what Jonas calls the “Muskonomy.”
  “We think that there's a possibility that the Dojo system isn't just being built to accelerate and train FSD and Optimus (Tesla bot); rather it could be a solution that builds a moat around Tesla and Musk-universe companies with highly advanced ML (machine learning) and AI capabilities,” Jonas wrote to his clients.
Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
“Looking internally at other Musk companies, we believe that Dojo may have the capability to be the core of the Muskonomy.”
  For example: “Twitter can benefit from shifting away from its current compute systems and switching to no/low-cost data computation from the most powerful supercomputer systems in the world, greatly accelerating the platform to new heights,” Jonas wrote.","Technology & Computing

 The analyst initiated coverage of Fisker Inc. (NYSE: FSR) with a Buy rating and price target of $12.
 Rivian Solidly Positioned But Manufacturing Challenges Remain: Rivian is the closest competitor to Tesla, given its strong balance sheet, early mover advantage, cutting-edge proprietary technology and fresh designs that excite early EV adopters, Bagri said.
 The company has a large order for commercial vehicles and a smaller SUV model on the horizon, potentially driving continued market share gains, the analyst said.
 Upside Catalysts For Tesla: Renewed federal tax credit eligibility under the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the potential credit-rating upgrade to investment grade by year-end, the first deliveries of Cybertruck in 2023, expansion of the charging network, and an increase in gross margin due to the 4680 cells are all likely to act as upside catalysts for the stock, according to Bagri.","Personal Finance

If You Invested $1,000 In Tesla Stock At Its Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now  Benzinga's Take: While stock splits don't create any inherent value, investors can expect big tech companies to continue to announce them as long as they keep generating big pops for the stocks.
Since Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) both recently announced stock splits, Colas said Tesla needs to do it as well to ensure it can give recruits as many shares as its big tech competitors.
""  The Case For A Split: First, Tesla's primary means of marketing is CEO Elon Musk's social media activity, and Colas said a lower stock price makes Tesla a more attractive investment for the small, retail investors that follow Musk's every tweet and post.
A stock split serves big themes like the democratization of investment opportunity and making a bigger tent for the Musk brand ahead of a SpaceX IPO sometime down the line.","Personal Finance

investors in Austin for a guided tour of the electric automaker's Texas Gigaplant.
We are also encouraged by the targeted combined unit volume of 5 million and we remain bullish on the opportunity presented within the next-gen platform.”
  Tesla also confirmed that the company is open to trying advertising and that, although the topic of advertising came up during this week's annual shareholder meeting and received warm reception from the audience, this has been contemplated upon internally by the team for several months already.
  
The analysts wrote in a note, “All in, we came away encouraged that Tesla could deliver cost improvements and efficiencies in the quarter ahead which may help offset some of the pressures, but we still worry the company may have to take additional price cuts in a weakening environment, which could put further pressure on earnings.
Analysts were, once again, impressed with the plant, which they say is “well designed and runs very efficiently, and is clearly making good progress in ramping up both vehicles and battery cells volumes, and in installing tooling for Cybertruck.”
  Tesla stated that these developments are expected to lead to cost reductions, with benefits such as the reduction of expenses associated with initial factory setup, decreased raw material prices, utilization of IRA credits, supplier negotiations, and the re-engineering of components.
  
At the same time, the company reiterated that the environment could get more challenging in the next 12 months, and that the company remains committed to growing volume as long as it generates positive free cash flow.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) investment story hangs on ""high expectations and low-probability"" outcomes, a bearish analyst recently said.
 
The fact that Tesla did not discuss the price cuts or delivery metrics, even in the Q&A session, was an indication that the action was not bringing in the desired effect, he said.
  
The bearish analyst also weighed in on Tesla's recent price cuts.
He disagreed with the view among Tesla bulls that the price cuts would kickstart demand and CEO Elon Musk's assertion on the March 1 Investor Day that demand was extremely elastic.
  
Dickson, who is short on Tesla, wondered whether deliveries or the success of the company's self-driving software would adequately justify the valuation.

As the Cybertruck launch event fast approaches, an analyst at Jefferies says cancelling the electric pick-up truck could prove to be positive for Tesla shares.
 
“Tesla looks stuck in a slow lane for another 12-18 months, unable to capitalize on peer delays while European legacy OEMs launch $/€25k EVs next year and Chinese carmakers set a new pace of shorter product cycles,” the analyst said.
  
The Tesla Thesis: “With 2024 already a lost year for growth,” a Cybertruck cancellation would help Tesla refocus on an “edge that was built on simplicity, scale and speed,” Houchois said in a note published on Monday.
  
Tesla Price Action: Shares of Tesla were down 0.4% to $233.15 at last check Monday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

To that end, Yanoshik's Tesla downgrade makes a couple key points for investors to consider:
  #1: Tesla's Valuation Isn't Cheap
  Tesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500, as investors bake in above-market growth rates for the EV beast.
  
Yet
  Investors have been clamoring for a cheaper ""Model 2"" from Tesla under the $30,000 price point.
Yanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits.
  
Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik slashed his rating on the stock to hold from buy on Wednesday, citing mostly valuation relative to when bets on a cheaper new vehicle model and other technologies would bear fruit.

 Needham & Company has a new EV analyst who took over coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and upgraded the shares to Hold from Underperform and launched coverage on three other EV stocks – Fisker (Buy), Rivian (Hold), and Lucid (Underperform).
 The analyst initiated coverage on Fisker Inc (NYSE: ) with a buy rating and a $12 price target, noting that the company is entering the EV market with SUVs that feature cutting-edge technology at an affordable price (starting price below $40,000 for the Fisker Ocean), which opens a vast opportunity set for the company.
While the Lucid Air is the epitome of luxury in EV sedans and is attractively priced relative to its competition, the analyst said that profitability is far out in the future, production has been slow to ramp, several key company officers have left recently, software in the vehicles needs work, and he believes it will need more capital by Q1/23.
The analyst mentioned the following potential catalysts that could drive the stock higher: (1) renewed federal tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, (2) potential credit rating upgrade to IG by YE, (3) the first deliveries of the Cybertruck in 2023, (4) expansion of the charging network and improved utilization, and (5) gross margin improvement driven by 4680 cells.
While the company is in a solid position, the analyst believes the competition will get intense, profitability is still far out, manufacturing challenges remain, and the company will require additional capital in 2024 and beyond.","Personal Finance

 Stock splits don't actually change anything fundamental about the company enacting a split, yet a cheaper share price can make the stock more accessible to a larger number of investors.
 Ritholtz Wealth Management's Josh Brown offered an explanation for Amazon's underperformance Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report.""  Although there was some excitement when Amazon announced the split, by the time it actually went into effect, Amazon shares were already locked into a massive downtrend, Brown said: ""This is one of those situations where there were a lot of reasons for it to have had the big bounce, and they just haven't worked out.""

steep overnight losses in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) after the firm's quarterly results missed estimates following a string of aggressive price cuts this year.
  
The move marks an escalation in Tesla's bitter price war to capture market share from legacy automobile makers in the U.S., while also looking to expand its footprint in China, its biggest market.
  
But this invited similar price cuts from Chinese EV makers, which analysts warn could dent industry profitability.
  XPeng founder He Xiaopeng warned that increased competition could result in the weeding out of some local players.
Losses in Asian stocks came after Tesla sank around 6% in after-hours trade, as its quarterly profit and gross margins missed estimates after the firm cut the prices of its cars at least six times this year.
  
CEO Elon Musk also doubled down on the price cuts, stating that the EV maker will prioritize sales growth over profit in worsening economic conditions.","Stocks

Unrealized gains, gains in the value of a stock or other asset prior to being sold, are not taxable because the owner doesn't have access to that value until the asset is sold.
These loans are a way billionaires can take advantage of the value of their stocks and other assets without actually selling them and triggering a taxable event.
Here's What Warren Buffett Thinks About Tesla And Elon Musk  Stock Collateral Loans: The U.S. tax code only taxes investors for capital gains, gains on shares of stocks and other investments, and when they sell the shares.

  Jewsikow said the fourth-quarter earnings results from Tesla were “soft,” with gross margins coming in below analyst estimates and a lower tax rate helping the earnings beat.
  
“We believe Bulls will interpret order commentary as TSLA largely derisking the 1.8 million delivery guidance at current prices globally, but we feel this is misguided as supply continues to ramp and the demand pull-forward from price reductions wanes.”

""How about the fact that Tesla is beginning to lose share,"" Cramer said Wednesday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk On The Street.""
  Tesla's success in the electric vehicle market has essentially forced traditional automakers to ramp up offerings in the booming EV industry.
Just last week, Ford announced a new round of price increases for its flagship electric truck.

  Ford can't keep up with demand, Cramer said: ""In part, because the grid is so bad in this country that people are buying the F-150 in order to be able to make it so if the grid goes down, they can light their houses up.""
  A fully-charged F-150 Lightning with an extended-range battery pack is supposed to be able to power an entire house for up to three days, according to Ford.
  
Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co 's (NYSE: NYSE: F ) share of the EV market has jumped from 1.88% to 5.5%, Cramer said, adding there are other automakers who are seeing increased market share year-over-year.

RBC also believes Tesla will continue to adjust prices as needed to help keep demand high, but the firm sees this as a positive as the EV maker is ""more capable of absorbing price cuts"" than the majority of its competitors.
  
The Details: Tesla produced 440,808 vehicles in the first quarter, up from 439,701 last quarter and strong enough for a majority of analysts.","Stocks

Analysts wrote in a note, “Most investors will be unsurprised to learn that our 2023-2025 estimates are moving lower, to reflect price cuts and a coincident impact on margins.
Since the Q1 call, investors have fretted about Tesla's willingness to trade price for volume, and while we share management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, this won't occur quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.
On the bright side, we think global ASP could fall by ~$125/unit every quarter for the next 2 years without impacting margins, due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).”
  With prices and margins falling, analysts believe that the valuation could languish for a few months.
However, until margins and other fundamentals start improving, they believe that TSLA may struggle to ""catch a bid"".","Personal Finance

Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stand in a California court room Friday to testify in the lawsuit over his controversial “funding secured” tweet in 2018.


Tesla (TSLA), Musk and company directors are facing a shareholder lawsuit over his infamous 2018 tweet, which said that he was thinking about taking Tesla (TSLA) private at a price of $420 a share.


But he concluded the tweet with two words that have resulted in the CEO having to pay millions of dollars in fines and legal fees: “Funding secured.”

Musk had spoken to executives of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund about the funding he would need to take Tesla private.
Musk argued Friday that his tweets do not cause Tesla’s stock price to move higher or lower.


Musk testified Friday that no one at Tesla reviewed his tweets in 2018 before he published them.

Shares in Tesla’s Chinese rivals fell on Thursday, after CEO Elon Musk signaled that the company will continue cutting prices to boost demand for electric cars in an increasingly competitive market.




In China, the world’s largest EV market, Tesla started cutting prices in October after it lost market share to its competitors, such as Warren Buffett-backed BYD.
A number of car manufacturers in China followed suit by cutting prices or offering discounts, including Xpeng, Leapmotor, BYD and Huawei’s EV unit.


In early January, it slashed prices again for its China-made Model 3 and Model Y.

Tesla has cut prices in many markets worldwide to bolster demand amid a growing challenge from other EV makers.
In January, sales of Tesla’s China-made vehicles jumped 10% from the same period a year ago, according to statistics released by the China Passenger Car Association.","Electric Vehicle

Musk has previously fallen foul of regulators for posting tweets that have moved Tesla's stock price, without previously consulting the board or fully vetting the material information he was providing shareholders.
To settle the charges, Musk agreed to a court-approved deal that required that Tesla directorsreview any social media posts containing information ""material"" to shareholders.
He has owned 80% of those 170.5 million Tesla shares since the company's initial public offering in 2010.

 With Tuesday's option exercise on 1.6 million shares on Tuesday, Musk, already the company's largest shareholder, has exercised all of the options on 22.8 million shares, which were due to expire in August.
 While the poll made it look like Musk would be directed by popular opinion – and the voting eventually favored him selling the stake – it was always likely to happen, as he needed money to pay a large tax bill on his newly acquired Tesla stock from the options due to expire, or else give up billions of dollars worth in options.
 Tesla has dropped 11% since the Musk poll, though that poll also coincided with an all-time high for shares.
Elon Musk exercised all of his options expiring next year, an indication that he is close to meeting his pledge of selling 10% of his stake in the EV-maker if he hasn't already honored it.","Personal Finance

And with others likely to face a long path to reaching appropriate EV margins, we expect the Tesla cost lead to be sustained for quite some time.”
  Finally - Levy says that while Tesla's gross margins may be pressured by factors like price cuts and the potential loss of IRA tax credits for some models due to battery sourcing, in the long term Levy says cheaper materials pricing, and the benefits of economies of scale for its factory ramp ups across the globe will continue “to offer a COGS (cost of goods sold” tailwind throughout the year,” which would benefit those gross margins.
  
“We believe price cuts are likely to be core for Tesla in unlocking additional volume, especially as Tesla ramps on further capacity,” Levy says.
However, Levy and Barclays feel Tesla can weather these price cuts better than any other operator in the space.
  
During the presentation, Tesla execs mentioned the company had reached at 4M vehicles produced since its inception, and since estimates before Q1 had seen the company hit around 3.725 million, Levy says this implies around 275K produced through the first two months of Q1.","Electric Vehicle

Dogecoin has so far found little practical use and remained on the fridge, owing most of its popularity to its association with Musk.","Electric Vehicle

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is scheduled to report its second-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.

The long-term question is not about auto gross margin, excluding credits, but about whether Tesla can get to 10-20% of the market share when eventually EVs account for 100% of the vehicles sold, he said.
  
What Happened: The key topic obviously for earnings is going to be auto gross margins ex-credits, and the Street is looking for it to come in at 19%, said Gene Munster, Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management, in an interview with CNBC.
""I don't think that's gonna be an issue for the stock ultimately because I think the commentary from the CFO is going to be to expect improving gross margins throughout the back half of the year,"" Munster said.
  
Ford's EV division is losing 40% and Polestar Automotive Holding UK Plc (NASDAQ:PSNY) about 45%, while Tesla is making about 15% operating margin.

The Tesla Thesis: The fall in electric vehicle prices is a function of slowing demand, sharply recovering supply, easing input prices, cost/scale improvements, competition and the federal EV tax credit, Jonas said in a note.
  
Answering an investor question on the impact of the price cuts on Tesla's margin, Jonas said he would be prepared for up to 500 basis points of headwind at the auto gross margin level, excluding zero-emission vehicle credit, throughout the course of 2023.
“Tesla's price cuts are, all else equal, an adverse fundamental development vs. market expectations but we believe potentially far worse for the company's EV competitors,” the analyst said.
The analyst also delved into the impact of Tesla's price cuts on competitors such as Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID), Fisker Inc. (NYSE: FSR) and legacy automakers.

Under questioning, Musk defended himself, saying he upheld his duty to increase Tesla’s market value, but conceded that he at times does not seek board approval for public statements.
Musk was awarded the compensation package in 2018, and shareholders approved the deal at the time.

If confirmed, the event would mark TSLA's second wave of staff cuts within just 8 months – in early June, the company's CEO Elon Musk announced a 10% workforce reduction citing worsening macro conditions and overly aggressive hiring in prior periods.
  
No major car maker has implemented layoffs lately, but Tesla is not the only technology company seeking to get a tighter grip on labor costs – tech giants like Meta (NASDAQ: META ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), among many others, have all announced hiring freezes and cuts over the past few months.
  
The rumor also echoes TSLA's current stock downfall – shares of the EV giant are down over 65% YTD, battered by global economic struggles, as well as controversial moves by its leader Elon Musk, most notably his Twitter acquisition and the Tesla share sales he has made to finance it.
  
TSLA is gaining nearly 1% in early pre-market trading after losing 8% in prior trading session.","Personal Finance

 Last week, Tesla mentioned that it had liquidated about 75% of its Bitcoin holdings to add $936 million to the EV giant's balance sheet in its second quarter.
 Musk said that he sold Tesla's Bitcoin as a hedge against the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty global markets face.
 Tesla ended the first quarter of 2022 with $1.26 billion of Bitcoin on its balance sheet.

 In a recent interview, Zhao said people shouldn't read too deeply into Elon Musk cashing out of Bitcoin so heavily.","Electric Vehicle

 Shares of Ford Motor (NYSE: ) fell on Monday after the company was forced to slash prices of its flagship electric vehicle (EV) model after key rival Tesla (NASDAQ: ) announced big pricing cuts.
Summary
  Ford has slashed the price of its Mustang Mach-E SUV crossover in a move that comes after rival Tesla continued to lower prices to drive up demand.
The move, which comes just weeks after Tesla announced similar plans, will see Ford reduce the price of its Mach-E by around $4,500, depending on the vehicle's configuration.
  
Customers who already ordered the Mach-E model and are awaiting delivery will automatically receive the reduced price, while those who already bought the vehicle after Jan. 1 can expect Ford to contact them with a “private offer,” the carmaker said.
  
Tesla Leads, Ford Follows
  Overall, Ford's reductions are in the range of $600 to $5,900, compared to Tesla's significant price cut of up to $13,000 on its Model Y vehicle earlier this month.","Electric Vehicle

  The bullish note on Tesla comes after the company reported a mixed fourth-quarter and full-year outlook

Analyst Mark Delaney, who maintained a Buy rating and $200 price target on the stock, reiterated his case in a note following Tesla's earnings on Wednesday.
The economic warning appears to have been baked into Tesla's 2023 volume growth guidance of 38%, which fell below a longer-term target of 50%.

's (NASDAQ: TSLA) management on the earnings call, all point to a surge in orders for the company's vehicles following the recent price cuts.
 
Here's how some of Tesla's smaller rivals fared since Jan. 12:
  Chinese EV startup Nio Inc. (NYSE: NIO): +2.5%
  XPeng Inc. (NYSE: XPEV): +1.3%
  Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI): +11.3%
  BYD Manufacturing Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) (OTC: BYDDF): +4.8%
  Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID): +8.3%
  Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN): +4.2%
  Source: FactSet
  Why It's Important: Tesla has heated up competition in the EV race with its aggressive price cuts in China, U.S. and Europe.
“While in the near-term Tesla is sacrificing margins for higher volumes, we view this as the right strategic poker move to put an iron fence around its customer base and fend off growing EV competition coming from Detroit, Europe, and China,” said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent note.
  
Since Jan. 12, a day ahead of the price cuts in the U.S., Tesla has gained roughly about 30%.
A chart shared by financial data provider FactSet showed that the stock rally accelerated since the Austin, Texas-based company disclosed price cuts in the U.S. earlier this month.

Shares in Tesla’s Chinese rivals fell on Thursday, after CEO Elon Musk signaled that the company will continue cutting prices to boost demand for electric cars in an increasingly competitive market.




In China, the world’s largest EV market, Tesla started cutting prices in October after it lost market share to its competitors, such as Warren Buffett-backed BYD.
A number of car manufacturers in China followed suit by cutting prices or offering discounts, including Xpeng, Leapmotor, BYD and Huawei’s EV unit.


In early January, it slashed prices again for its China-made Model 3 and Model Y.

Tesla has cut prices in many markets worldwide to bolster demand amid a growing challenge from other EV makers.
In January, sales of Tesla’s China-made vehicles jumped 10% from the same period a year ago, according to statistics released by the China Passenger Car Association.","Electric Vehicle

""Even a small cooling of demand will have significant implications for the bottom line,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (LON: HRGV
  Tesla said that its automotive gross margins, which dropped to a two-year low of 25.9% in the reported quarter, were pressured by the costs of ramping up battery production and new factories in Berlin and Texas, as well as higher raw material, commodity, logistics and warranty costs.

The company slightly beat Wall Street targets for fourth-quarter revenue and profit earlier on Wednesday despite a sharp decline in vehicle profit margins, and it sought to reassure investors that it can cut costs to cope with recession and as competition intensifies in the year ahead.

 What Happened: Short seller Spruce Point Capital Management on Wednesday released a bearish report on FIGS Inc (NYSE: FIGS), claiming that the company has a history of exaggerating key financial metrics.
 Why It Matters: Spruce Point alleges that FIGS previously claimed to have generated more than $100 million in revenue in 2018, but the company's IPO prospectus shows just $55 million in revenue in 2018, according to the report.
Spruce Point also argues that FIGS' total addressable market is less than half of what the company says.
 ""Based on our forensic review of FIGS' claims, severe allegations of false advertising and unfair business practices from an ongoing lawsuit against management, and commentary of former employees suggesting a toxic culture, we believe FIGS' management is prone to exaggerating financial performance and business claims and lacks the leadership necessary to execute,"" the short seller wrote in the report.","Personal Finance

Slights said the deal process had its flaws and Musk was more involved than he should have been, but a fair price for SolarCity outweighed claims the deal unjustly enriched Musk.
Union pension funds and asset managers alleged that Musk commandeered Tesla's negotiations for SolarCity while publicly claiming to be ""fully recused.

For nearly 40 years, Chanos has been a vocal skeptic of overvalued or fraudulent companies, famously profiting from the downfall of Enron, while enduring losses in his long-standing bets against companies like Tesla and AOL.
  
Jim Chanos , a prominent figure in Wall Street known for his bearish market stance, is closing
the chapter on his hedge funds that specialize in short selling, The Wall Street Journal reports.
  
Chanos has been a vocal Tesla bear, recently saying that the EV maker's stock is “ridiculously overvalued.”
  At 65, Chanos acknowledges the shifting dynamics of the market.
In recent times, Chanos has found it challenging to capitalize on his bearish bets, particularly as the market trends upward.","Personal Finance

Assuming Musk will be able to close the Twitter deal by the end of this year, the next big question that still troubles many investors is whether the world's richest man could be spreading himself too thin taking on this new challenge?
 Bottom Line  Musk's involvement in Twitter is another distraction that Tesla's investors have to deal with, especially when the competition in the EV market is heating up.
 Musk had lined up $13 billion in bank financing, $12.5 billion in margin loans backed by Tesla shares, and committed to another $21 billion himself to acquire the social media company.
 Musk is undoubtedly taking a good deal of risk by using Tesla shares as collateral even after securing new commitments.","Personal Finance

Tesla reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the full year, but said its profit margins were tighter due to higher costs, recent price cuts, and sales in the quarter that were weaker than hoped.


Tesla said Wednesday that it expects sales of about 1.8 million vehicles this year, up 37% from 2022 sales of 1.3 million vehicles.


The leading electric vehicle maker posted adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share in the quarter, up from 85 cents a share a year earlier, and its previous record of $1.07 a share in the first quarter.
Tesla’s once high-flying shares lost 65% of their value last year, the worst year ever for the company’s stock.
Its previous aggressive growth rates and strong profit margins were factors that made Tesla the most valuable automaker in the world by far, despite having a fraction of the sales volume of other global automakers.

Lastly, Deutsche Bank also anticipates investors will seek more clarity on Tesla's qualifications for the $7,500 consumer EV credit and the magnitude of the battery production credit.

 Sentiment towards the EV sector was also buoyed by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ), which logged a record number of vehicle deliveries in the second quarter.
  
XPeng (NYSE: XPEV ) was the best performer among the lot, rising 13.6% after the firm logged a nearly 15% month-on-month jump in June deliveries, while Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI ) clocked record deliveries in June.
  
The pick-up in Chinese deliveries comes after several months of laggard sales, and also reflects the increased competition in the market stemming from a price war earlier this year.
Price cuts by Tesla had triggered similar moves by both EV and traditional vehicle makers in a bid to capture Chinese market share.

In: Following a Bloomberg report that suggested Twitter's board has re-engaged with Tesla, Inc. ( : TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and an agreement could be reached as soon as Monday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said it now appears that Twitter hasn't hit it off with any other potential private-equity buyers.
 Musk May Not Have To Heavily Liquidate Tesla Stock: The amended filing with the SEC showed that Musk may have to shell out $21 billion in equity financing from his Tesla/SpaceX holdings, which will be a fraction of the Tesla CEO's current holding in the EV company, the analyst noted.
 ""The Street will read this news today as the beginning of the end for Twitter as a public company with Musk likely now on a path to acquire the company unless a second bidder comes into the mix,"" the analyst said.
 ""We do not believe this Twitter bid will result in a major sale of Musk's Tesla shares, instead being used as pledged shares for the loans obtained by Musk,"" Ives said.","Personal Finance

Wolfe believes that investors will eventually come back to TSLA as the company continues to be a driver for earnings growth.
“Said simply, Tesla was always going to have to reduce prices in all their key markets to support their aggressive volume growth target of 50% avg annual growth.”

In the same text message, Musk added: “You also made it clear that you were the decision-maker, moreover backed strongly by the Crown Prince, who regards this as strategically important at a national level.”
  Musk urged al-Rumayyan to make a statement confirming that the Saudi wealth fund wanted to help take Tesla private.
A series of text messages between Musk and al-Rumayyan from 2018, which were revealed in a June court filing in the litigation, offer some insight into the funding discussions between Musk's Tesla and the sovereign wealth fund, which already had a small investment in the carmaker.
  
In the text exchange between the two men, which took place in the wake of the backlash to the “funding secured” tweet, Musk hinted at a conversation they had at Tesla in which al-Rumayyan said he was “definitely interested in taking Tesla private and had wanted to do so since 2016.”

  CNN —
  Tesla (TSLA) shareholders sued Musk in 2018, alleging that he did not, in fact, have “funding secured” to take the company private at $420 per share, as he had said in a tweet that year, a number that seemingly referenced the unofficial holiday of cannabis enthusiasts.","Personal Finance

Morgan Stanley Analyst Thinks Now Is The Right Moment","Benzinga - Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has highlighted the need for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to establish a full-scale financing subsidiary to cater to the evolving auto market and meet customer demands.
 
The Tesla Thesis : With the increasing preference for monthly payment options and the potential impact of IRA leasing rules, Jonas believes the time is right for Tesla to develop a comprehensive financing offering.
  
Key Points : Jonas presented several reasons supporting the establishment of Tesla Financial Services:
  Market Demand: As Tesla targets multi-million unit volumes, financing becomes crucial as the norm for car purchases, and Tesla must adapt to facilitate customer requirements.
  
Conclusion : Jonas said Tesla's strong financial position, potential partnerships, expansive network, and commitment to cost leadership make it well-positioned to establish a successful financing subsidiary.
  
“By not having a comprehensive financing offering, Tesla may be leaving sales on the table,” Jonas wrote.

 What Happened: Plans from Tesla and CEO Elon Musk to add a restaurant and dine-in theater at a Supercharger location date back to 2018.
Not every location would be suited for a restaurant or dine-in theater, but some of the larger and most trafficked locations could bring additional revenue to Tesla with these added services.
Some restaurants have in the past offered free delivery to nearby Supercharger locations, a move that doesn't bring additional revenue to Tesla.","Electric Vehicle

Jerry Braakman, president of First American Trust, wants Tesla’s board to send a clear message that Musk went too far last week by agreeing with an antisemitic post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that claims Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”

“I believe in free speech, but there’s no excuse for spreading hatred by a CEO of a public company,” Braakman said in a statement.


‘No confidence’ in the board

Nell Minow, a Tesla shareholder and vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises institutional investors on corporate governance matters, said Tesla’s board should hire a firm to evaluate the impact on the car company’s brand from Musk’s “terrible behavior.”

“I had been thinking about buying a Tesla but that’s off the table now.
—

Tesla’s board of directors should suspend Elon Musk for endorsing antisemitic views on social media, according to an investor in the electric vehicle company and a leading management expert.


Minow said she has “no confidence whatsoever” in the willingness of Tesla’s board to provide meaningful oversight over Musk.

 Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events.

The access to Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS), while the company continues to build its own Rivian Adventure fast-charging network, will allow access to a very large car park, which in turn would help Rivian's charging network to reach profitability, the CEO added.
  
The agreement allows Rivian customers to charge their vehicles on Tesla's supercharger network of more than 12,000 superchargers starting in spring 2024.
  
Why It Matters: Rivian signed an agreement with Tesla to adopt the NACS in June.
This is the first time any of the companies that joined Tesla's charging network have spoken about paying for the service.

Should you?","""The reason we sold a bunch of our bitcoin holdings was that we were uncertain as to when the Covid lockdowns in China would alleviate,"" Musk said on an earnings call with analysts Wednesday evening.
""Traders should not be surprised that Musk supported Tesla's selling of bitcoin, as the crypto winter was clearly in place and as the balance sheet needed to be strengthened,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA, a foreign exchange trading company, said in a report. ""
But some analysts wondered if other big investors will use Tesla's bitcoin sale as justification to unload some of their cryptocurrency holdings as well.
But is the change in Tesla's bitcoin stance really a reason to dump crypto — or just a convenient excuse after a nice little rally?
The Tesla sell-off can trigger a new wave of related dumping from corporate bitcoin holders, most of which might also be distressed by the ongoing global economic downturn,"" Andrey Diyakonov, chief commercial officer at Choise.com, a crypto wallet firm, said in an email to CNN Business.","Construction

Musk started selling off some of his shares in November after he conducted a poll on Twitter asking his millions of followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock in order to raise his taxable income.
Elon Musk appears to have wrapped up a busy year of trading his Tesla shares Tuesday.
Although that bill currently appears unlikely to become law , it was still very much in play when Musk set up his pre-arranged trading plan, meaning there was still a significant risk of a higher tax bill if he waited until next year.
Unless he sells an additional 1.3 million of the shares he now owns, he'll fall just short of that 10% pledge, but he said in a recent interview with a YouTuber that he's ""sold enough stock to get to around 10%,"" so Tuesday's sales are apparently the culmination of the process for the year.","Personal Finance

market closed on Thursday, a figure that is within the range of the InvestingPro Fair Value of $251.14.
It's worth noting that, according to InvestingPro data, Tesla's revenue growth for the last quarter was 39.99%, demonstrating the company's ability to generate increased revenues despite substantial R&D expenses.
  
InvestingPro metrics reveal that Tesla's operating income, adjusted for the last quarter, stood at $12.65 billion, which is a testament to the company's financial performance.
  
Despite increased operating expenses of $2.41 billion in Q3 due to AI investments, Tesla still managed a nearly 9% year-on-year revenue growth.
The company's steady Bitcoin holdings and continued investments in AI reflect a financial prudence strategy amidst market uncertainties, as it navigates the challenges of lower-than-expected revenues and increased operational costs.","Personal Finance

Telsa's Frankfurt-listed shares rose 4.1% to 953 euros ($1,102.05) in early trade to recoup some of the heavy losses suffered earlier in the week, in the period when Musk had sold.
The sales equate to about 3% of Musk's total holdings, though it wasn't clear if they related to his weekend Twitter poll.
Filings showed Musk's trust sold nearly 3.6 million shares in Tesla, worth around $4 billion, while he also sold another 934,000 shares for $1.1 billion to cover tax obligations after exercising options to acquire nearly 2.2 million shares.
Investors downplayed the significance of Musk's trading for the stock's outlook, pointing instead to strong car orders and Musk's professed faith in the company, though brokers said it could be a bumpy day in U.S. trade ahead.","Personal Finance

RBC analysts wrote in a note, “Unlike legacy OEM peers in the US who are pursuing JVs to make battery cells, Tesla is going solo – which should enable it to capitalize on IRA credits more than any other automaker and even be a tier 1 battery supplier.”
  Beyond batteries, Tesla's Nevada facility also manufactures drive units.
Tesla intends to expand the current facility by adding 100 GWh, and this expansion will exclusively feature Tesla's production of 4680 cells, without any involvement from Panasonic.
The plant houses both Panasonic (TYO: ) (OTC: PCRFY ), which produces all the cells in a separate section, and Tesla, responsible for assembling the packs/modules.

Tesla reported a drop in third quarter earnings as the electric vehicle maker fell short of Wall Street expectations.


Tesla earned $2.3 billion in the quarter, or 66 cents a share, down 37% from a year earlier and the smallest profits it reported in two years.
Tesla has been cutting the prices of its vehicles to boost sales demand in the face of growing electric vehicle competition from established automakers.


The company also missed on third quarter revenue of $23.4 billion, up 9% from a year earlier but short of the $24.1 billion forecast by analysts.
Tesla also said it still expects to begin delivery of the long-delayed Cybertruck pickup by the end of this year.

(AP) — Attorneys for a Tesla shareholder urged a Delaware judge on Tuesday to invalidate a 2018 compensation
package awarded by the company's board of directors to CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth more than $55 billion.
  
But attorney Greg Varallo argued that the Tesla defendants should be required to show that the compensation plan was “entirely fair” to stockholders because Musk was a controlling shareholder.
  
Defense attorneys countered that the pay plan was fairly negotiated by a compensation committee whose members were independent, contained performance milestones that were so lofty they were ridiculed by some Wall Street investors, and blessed by a shareholder vote that was not even required under Delaware law.
The plan called for Musk to reap billions if Tesla hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones.
For each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant.","Options

Even if the D3 had labor cost parity with Tesla, D3's profitability in the EV market seems challenging without significant taxpayer support or strategic changes.

  In 2019, when the UAW went on strike for a grueling six weeks, Tesla had a 1% US market share and financial troubles.

 “At current share prices, we not only believe the EV 'option' value has been appropriately compressed to near zero NPV (as it should be), but the market may also be undervaluing the run-off cash flows of the ICE (NYSE: ) portfolio which is going too far, in our view,” Jonas added.
 New price targets for Tesla and GM are $1,150 and $42 per share, down from $1,200 and $44, respectively.

The shareholders also said a federal judge found that Musk's 2018 tweets in which he claimed to have the funding to take Tesla private were false and misleading.

 Tesla was one of the largest companies to put Bitcoin on its balance sheet and the move could be judged by outsiders now as an unwise decision given the $1.5 billion investment is now worth less than it originally was at the time of purchase.
 The Bitcoin holdings could become a larger topic than normal when Tesla reports its second-quarter earnings.
 The exact amount of Bitcoin held by Tesla and the cost basis for the cryptocurrency are unknown, but a range can be speculated based on the purchase price and timing.
Tesla already reported an impairment loss in 2021 on its Bitcoin holdings, which could make the loss lower than Lee expects.","Electric Vehicle
